# PythonEncoder
This is a simple encoder/decoder created over the course of 24 hours in an attempt to learn tkinter for gui applications.
The program randomly assigns one of four cipher keys to the user and returns their encoded information. They can then return and
decode their information by entering their given cipher key and their encoded information. Ideally, the gui interface created through
the python library, tkinter, will allow the program to be used with relative ease.

Nothing other than an up-to-date Python 3 IDE should be needed to run the program.
